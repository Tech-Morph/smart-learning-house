# 🏠 Daikin Comfort Control Smart Temperature

A **Home Assistant custom integration** (HACS-compatible) that adds autonomous, learning-based temperature management on top of [Daikin Comfort Control](https://github.com/Tech-Morph/daikin_comfort_control).

This is a **companion integration** — it does not talk to the Daikin cloud directly. Instead, it attaches to the `DaikinCoordinator` that `daikin_comfort_control` already created, reads the AC's built-in indoor and outdoor temperature sensors (`htemp` / `otemp`), and issues control commands back through the same authenticated API instance. One cloud connection. No duplicated auth. No extra hardware.

> **Part of the Daikin ecosystem:** install [`daikin_comfort_control`](https://github.com/Tech-Morph/daikin_comfort_control) first — it handles the cloud connection, climate entity, and sensors. This repo builds the autonomous decision-making layer on top of it.

### Temperature Source

Two sensors, both free — no ESP32, no DHT22, no MQTT broker required:

- **`htemp`** — the thermistor built into the Daikin indoor unit itself
- **`otemp`** — the outdoor temperature reading the unit already reports

Both are read from the coordinator's cached state, not via a separate API poll.

### Mode Selection Logic

| Condition | Mode |
|---|---|
| `htemp` within ±tolerance of target | `fan_only` (just circulate) |
| `htemp` > target + tolerance | `cool` *(if allowed)* |
| `htemp` < target − tolerance | `heat` *(if allowed and season gate passes)* |

**Season-aware heat gate:** in `summer` season mode, heating is only permitted when `htemp` has dropped to/below `summer_heat_min_temp` **and** `otemp` is at/below `outdoor_heat_max` — preventing the heater from firing just because the AC overcooled the house on a mild evening. Optionally restrict heating to nighttime only via `summer_heat_night_only`.

**Pre-cooling:** if outdoor temp has risen more than `precool_rise_threshold` within the last 30 minutes, the effective tolerance band is tightened by `precool_tolerance_cut` — so cooling resumes sooner instead of coasting in fan-only while the afternoon heat climbs.

### Fan Speed Logic

| Delta from target | Fan rate |
|---|---|
| Within tolerance band | `A` (auto) |
| Up to `fan_close_delta` | `2` (low) |
| Up to `fan_mid_delta` | `3` (medium) |
| Beyond `fan_mid_delta` | `4` (high) — capped by `max_fan_mode` |

### Time-of-Day Learning Slots

A fixed offset (°F) is added to the base target temperature during each slot. Defaults:

| Slot | Hours | Default offset |
|---|---|---|
| Morning | 6 am – 9 am | +0 °F |
| Day | 9 am – 5 pm | +1 °F |
| Evening | 5 pm – 10 pm | +1 °F |
| Night | 10 pm – 6 am | −2 °F |

All offsets are editable from the HA options flow — no YAML. Disable entirely to make target temperature exact 24/7.

### Rolling Learning Log

Each control cycle is recorded in memory (outdoor temp, indoor temp, target, mode, timestamp), capped at `learning_log_size` entries. This is currently a data-collection foundation for future empirical tuning — it does not change behavior on its own yet.

### Manual Override Detection

After every command, the controller records what it set (mode, fan, setpoint). On the next poll it compares that to what the coordinator reports as current state. If they differ — meaning someone used the Daikin app or IR remote — automation pauses for `override_timeout` seconds (default 30 min). Set to `0` to disable.

### Why Commands Are Sent as Full Payloads

The Daikin cloud API (`set_control_info`) requires **all fields** on every call — omitting any field causes the unit to revert it to a default. This behaviour was confirmed via mitmproxy capture of the official Android app and is documented in [daikin_comfort_control/daikin_api.py](https://github.com/Tech-Morph/daikin_comfort_control/blob/main/custom_components/daikin_comfort_control/daikin_api.py). Every command from this integration sends the full payload, preserving swing direction and humidity settings from the current coordinator state.
